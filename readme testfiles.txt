test1: 25 random item sizes between 0.1 and 10 and 15 periodic unavailabilities with random lengths between 0.1 and 10
test2: 25 item sizes of 1 and 15 random unavailabilities with random lengths between 0.1 and 10
test3: 25 random item sizes between 1 and 8 and periodic unavailability with random lengths between 0.1 and 10
test4: 25 random item sizes between 1 and 8 and 15 periodic unavailabilities with length 1
test5: lognormally randomly distributed input both 25 items and unavailabilities
